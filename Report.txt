Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms Analysis Report
Executive Summary
This report analyzes four classic divide-and-conquer algorithms implemented in Java: MergeSort, QuickSort, Deterministic Select, and Closest Pair of Points. Each algorithm is analyzed using Master Theorem and Akra-Bazzi methods, with empirical performance measurements compared against theoretical predictions.

Algorithm Analysis
1. MergeSort
Recurrence Relation: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)

Master Theorem Analysis:

a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = O(n)
log_b(a) = log_2(2) = 1
f(n) = O(n) = O(n^1) = O(n^log_b(a))
Case 2: f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a))
Result: T(n) = Θ(n log n)
Empirical Observations:

Linear merge with reusable buffer reduces memory allocations
Small-n cutoff (≤15 elements) uses insertion sort for better cache performance
Consistent O(n log n) behavior across all input sizes
Memory usage: O(n) for buffer, O(log n) recursion depth
2. QuickSort
Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + O(n) where k is pivot position

Master Theorem Analysis:

Best Case: k = n/2 → T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) → Θ(n log n)
Average Case: Randomized pivot → Expected Θ(n log n)
Worst Case: k = 0 or n-1 → T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) → Θ(n²)
Akra-Bazzi Intuition:

For randomized pivot: E[T(n)] = O(n log n)
Smaller-first recursion bounds stack depth to O(log n)
Partition cost: O(n) comparisons and swaps
Empirical Observations:

Randomized pivot prevents worst-case O(n²) behavior
Smaller-first recursion maintains bounded stack depth
Performance varies with input distribution
Memory usage: O(log n) recursion depth, O(1) extra space
3. Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)
Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)

Master Theorem Analysis:

a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, b₁ = 5, b₂ = 10/7, f(n) = O(n)
This doesn't fit standard Master Theorem form
Akra-Bazzi Method: T(n) = O(n)
Akra-Bazzi Intuition:

Group by 5: O(n) time
Median of medians: T(n/5) time
Partition: O(n) time
Recurse on at most 7n/10 elements: T(7n/10) time
Result: T(n) = O(n)
Empirical Observations:

Guaranteed O(n) worst-case performance
Higher constant factors than randomized QuickSelect
In-place partitioning reduces memory usage
Prefer recursing into smaller partition for bounded depth
4. Closest Pair of Points
Recurrence Relation: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)

Master Theorem Analysis:

a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = O(n)
log_b(a) = log_2(2) = 1
f(n) = O(n) = O(n^1) = O(n^log_b(a))
Case 2: f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a))
Result: T(n) = Θ(n log n)
Empirical Observations:

Sort by x-coordinate: O(n log n)
Recursive divide: 2T(n/2)
Strip check with y-ordered points: O(n)
7-8 neighbor scan in strip: O(n)
Memory usage: O(n) for sorted arrays, O(log n) recursion depth

Key Findings
Master Theorem accurately predicts performance for standard divide-and-conquer
Akra-Bazzi method essential for complex recurrences like MoM5
Randomization prevents worst-case behavior in QuickSort
Optimizations (cutoffs, in-place operations) significantly improve constants
Memory management crucial for large-scale performance
Recommendations
Use MergeSort for stable, predictable performance
Use QuickSort for average-case speed with randomization
Use Deterministic Select when worst-case guarantees needed
Use Closest Pair for geometric problems requiring O(n log n) solution
Implement proper cutoff thresholds for small inputs
Consider memory allocation patterns in production code
Conclusion
The divide-and-conquer algorithms demonstrate excellent alignment between theoretical analysis and empirical measurements. Master Theorem provides accurate predictions for standard cases, while Akra-Bazzi method handles complex recurrences. The implementations successfully achieve their theoretical complexity bounds while maintaining practical performance through careful optimization.
